Dev Overview
=====================================================

This project was originally created to be a small game for me to play that wouldn't take me
more than a day to write. As it usually goes, I kept wanting to add one more small feature here and there
and it became this monstrosity. All that said, some of this code is not structured in the best way possible.
I tried to refactor as I went but some sections are a bit too complicated and some classes have become
too bloated with one use helper functions.
